### <em>game should: 
- <em>track clicks that occur on the cells
- <em>check if a valid move has been made
- <em>prevent cells from being selected more than once
- <em>keep track of and validate game status
- <em>THEN change the active player

- <em>check if there is a winner or if there is a draw
- <em>stop the game once there is a win or draw
- <em>udpate the UI to reflect all of the above
